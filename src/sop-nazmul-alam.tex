\section*{Introduction}
\fi
Growing up in a rural community in Bangladesh, I experienced the challenges of limited resources and access to technology.
However, these constraints fostered resilience and a deep appreciation for learning.
My determination to excel in education led me to pursue higher secondary studies in Dhaka, where adapting to a new environment and lifestyle was both challenging and transformative.
Despite the difficulties, I embraced the opportunity, staying focused on my academic goals and igniting a lifelong passion for problem-solving through technology.

\section*{Academic Journey}
\fi
My pursuit of a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST) was a defining chapter in my journey.
Here, I discovered my passion for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), which culminated in my undergraduate thesis, \textit{Deep-eANN: A Novel Approach for Improved Classification of Precursor microRNA Using Artificial Neural Network Model}.
This research marked my first significant contribution to the field of AI and solidified my ambition to address real-world challenges through innovative solutions.

During my undergraduate studies, I actively participated in competitive programming contests, earning recognition at national and inter-university events.
These experiences sharpened my analytical and problem-solving skills, preparing me for the challenges of both academic research and professional roles.
Despite financial and resource limitations, I persevered, spending countless hours in university labs to practice coding and collaborate with peers.
