Born and raised in a rural area of Bangladesh with limited access to basic necessities like clean drinking water and electricity,
I am now on a mission to make technology accessible worldwide.
With 15 years of diverse industrial experience in core computer systems and artificial intelligence,
I am ready to pursue PhD studies at UNIVERSITY X to learn advanced research methods from leading researchers in the field
and tackle more complex real-world problems.

In 2006, I enrolled as an undergraduate student at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST),
one of the top Computer Science and Engineering programs, becoming one of the first in my community
to pursue an engineering degree at a renowned university.
I consistently ranked among the top students in my class and received multiple academic scholarships for my excellence.
Growing up in a challenging environment, I was always determined to make the most of every situation.
I actively engaged in competitive problem-solving from the start to sharpen my analytical skills, teamwork,
and ability to perform under pressure.
During my undergraduate years, I solved over a thousand programming problems, represented my university
in numerous competitive programming contests, and earned medals in national and online competitions.
This experience in problem-solving and analytical thinking enabled me to develop an advanced Artificial Neural Network
model for my thesis, Deep-eANN, in 2010, achieving a prediction accuracy of up to 99\% for the classification
of precursor microRNA without using any library APIs.

During my second year of undergraduate studies, my father’s return from overseas due to illness
created a financial challenge that required me to support my family.
I began tutoring students at home alongside my studies, earning enough to cover my expenses
and support my siblings until my graduation.
Although this impacted my academic routine to some extent, it allowed me to develop critical skills
such as time management, leadership, and resilience.
My efforts ensured that my younger siblings could continue their education.
In my final year, I had to take a full-time job to support my family, which meant I couldn't refine my thesis
for journal publication.
However, I made my work and report open-source to allow the research community to build upon it.
Despite the challenges, I take pride in the sacrifices I made, knowing that my siblings are now thriving
in their respective fields.

In 2011, I began my professional career as a Junior Software Engineer at Apurba Technologies Inc.,
followed by a similar role at Structured Data Systems Limited.
During this time, I had the opportunity to contribute to the Navigator application for AfriGIS,
aimed at providing efficient route guidance and enhancing the user experience.
This role introduced me to a professional R\&D experience, where I worked with large-scale geospatial data
and applied computational geometry and graph theory to optimize routing solutions.

In October 2013, I joined Eyeball Networks Inc. in Bangladesh as a Software Engineer.
In this role, I was responsible for developing the MS-SIP Library, which handled the session initiation process for VoIP calls,
as well as real-time bandwidth adjustment for HD video calls and RTP data compression.
Eyeball Networks was an offshore branch of AnyConnect Private Limited, headquartered in Singapore.
In 2015, AnyConnect Pvt Ltd decided to form an R\&D team made up of top-performing employees
from all its offshore branches to focus on their next-generation Internet-of-Things (IoT) products.
Due to my hard work and dedication, I earned a spot in the R\&D team and officially joined AnyConnect Pvt Ltd in October 2015.
At AnyConnect, I led the design and implementation of the Communication SDK, merging my technical expertise
with leadership to drive solutions that enhanced client interactions and system efficiencies.
I also supported AT\&T with on-site engineering solutions, ensuring seamless integration and functionality of our software offerings.

In September 2018, I began my tenure at Smarter AI, Dubai, UAE, where I currently hold the position of Senior Software Engineer.
At Smarter AI, I led the development of \textbf{Instant Streaming\textsuperscript{TM}}, a groundbreaking feature
that enabled Dashcams to establish seamless connectivity within one second.
This innovation significantly enhanced the user experience and reliability of intelligent transportation systems.
Additionally, I engineered advanced traffic feature identification algorithms leveraging OpenStreetMap data,
achieving high accuracy in real-time detection of speed limits, school zones, and speed cameras.
My role also encompassed modernizing legacy systems by transitioning core SDKs to a REST API-based architecture,
improving system concurrency and performance by 40\%.
Furthermore, I designed and implemented a CI/CD pipeline that automated periodic analytics reporting and health-report
analyses using Kibana and Elasticsearch, streamlining internal processes and enhancing client reporting capabilities.

During my final year of undergraduate studies, I took \textbf{Artificial Intelligence} with \textbf{Shahidul Islam}
and \textbf{Machine Learning} with \textbf{Dr. Ruhul Amin}, both of whom later became assistant professors
at universities in the United States.
Recognizing my perseverance and potential, they enthusiastically co-supervised my thesis, during which I significantly
improved the model’s accuracy and contributed to a published paper.
This formative experience laid the groundwork for my ongoing research journey, which has since expanded through various R\&D projects
focused on real-time smart systems.
Along the way, I have further developed my technical expertise and strengthened my commitment to continual learning.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of Computer Systems and Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing scalable algorithms
for large-scale applications—especially in intelligent transportation and autonomous systems.
I have chosen \textbf{Sample University} for its strong reputation in interdisciplinary research and excellence in AI and systems engineering.
The work of Professor \textbf{[Faculty Name]} in \textbf{[Research Area]} aligns closely with my own interests,
and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate under their mentorship.

Through a PhD program, my long-term goal is to bridge the gap between academia and industry
by developing innovative solutions to global challenges while mentoring future researchers.
I am also dedicated to inspiring young engineers in my home community to explore the transformative potential of technology.

I look forward to joining \textbf{[University X]} as a graduate student at your esteemed department.
