\ifshowsections\section*{Introduction}\fi


Growing up in a rural area in Bangladesh, I faced significant challenges due to limited access to technology and resources. These difficulties helped me develop resilience and a strong love for learning. My dedication to education led me to pursue higher secondary studies in Dhaka, where I adapted to a new environment despite the challenges. This experience strengthened my passion for using technology to address complex problems.


\ifshowsections\section*{Academic Journey}\fi


I’ve always worked hard to achieve my goals, consistently ranking among the top five in my class. My parents’ sacrifices had a profound impact on me. My father worked overseas under difficult conditions, while my mother constantly reminded me of the importance of preparing for the future. Their efforts inspired me to value education deeply.


I was the first in my family to attend an engineering school, breaking new ground. During my undergraduate studies at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST), I discovered my passion for artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). My thesis, \textit{Deep-eANN: A Novel Approach for Improved Classification of Precursor microRNA Using Artificial Neural Network Model}, marked my first major contribution to AI research. This work fueled my desire to solve real-world problems through innovative solutions.


I also participated in programming contests at national and inter-university levels, which sharpened my problem-solving and analytical skills. Despite financial challenges, I spent long hours practicing in university labs, preparing myself for future academic and professional pursuits.


\ifshowsections\section*{Personal Resilience and Sacrifices}\fi


During my second year of undergraduate studies, my father returned from overseas due to illness, making me the primary breadwinner for my family. As the second eldest among four siblings, I balanced academics and work to support my family. My efforts ensured that my younger brothers could continue their education. One is now an undergraduate student, and the other is nearing the completion of a marine degree. For over a decade, I prioritized their futures over my own aspirations, investing all I had in their stability.


One memorable moment in my academic journey was solving a challenging dynamics problem on my own two days after a contest where my team had struggled. This experience reinforced my belief in persistence and individual effort, qualities I continue to rely on.


\ifshowsections\section*{Professional Experience}\fi


My professional career spans over a decade and multiple countries, including Bangladesh, Singapore, and the UAE. At Smarter AI, I developed Instant Streaming\textsuperscript{TM}, enabling Dashcams to connect in under a second, and created traffic feature identification algorithms using geospatial data. These innovations have advanced intelligent transportation systems. Additionally, I modernized legacy systems by transitioning core SDKs to REST API architecture and developed CI/CD pipelines that automated analytics reporting and system health checks.


At AnyConnect, I led the design and implementation of a Communication SDK while supporting AT&T with on-site engineering solutions. Earlier in my career at Eyeball Networks, I contributed to the development of MS-SIP Library features like multi-video calls and codec adaptability. These experiences highlight my adaptability in addressing diverse technological challenges.


\ifshowsections\section*{Research Interests}\fi


My research journey began with my undergraduate thesis and has evolved through projects exploring real-time systems, feature detection algorithms, and optimization techniques. These efforts deepened my technical expertise and strengthened my commitment to advancing computer science. My skills span multiple programming languages (C++, Python, Java) and frameworks, as well as AI/ML tools that I have applied in various professional settings.


I am particularly interested in the intersection of AI, ML, and IoT. My research focuses on developing scalable algorithms for large-scale applications, with an emphasis on intelligent transportation and autonomous systems. Through a PhD program, I aim to explore cutting-edge methods in deep learning and optimization, contributing meaningfully to both academia and industry.
