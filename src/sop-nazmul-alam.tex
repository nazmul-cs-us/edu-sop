\ifshowsections\section*{Introduction}\fi

Emerging from a rural area in Bangladesh with limited access to technology, I cultivated a resilience
and an unwavering passion for learning. This drive propelled me to excel academically, culminating
in my pursuit of higher education at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (SUST) in Dhaka.
Here, amidst financial and personal challenges, I unearthed a profound interest in artificial intelligence
(AI) and machine learning (ML), setting the foundation for my commitment to leveraging technology to solve
intricate real-world problems.

\ifshowsections\section*{Academic Journey}\fi

Breaking new ground as the first in my family to pursue engineering, I embarked on my undergraduate studies
at SUST with determination and ambition. My academic journey was distinguished by consistently ranking
among the top of my class, securing scholarships for outstanding performance, and maintaining a GPA of
3.49/4. My dedication to excellence was further demonstrated through my active participation in
programming contests. I secured 11th place in the SUST National Collegiate Programming Contest
(2010) with my team, SUST 3!3, and achieved 20th place in the SUST Inter University Programming Contest
(2009) with SUST SHOINIK. Additionally, I qualified in Round One of prestigious global competitions
such as Google Code Jam and Facebook Hacker Cup, showcasing my problem-solving prowess and competitive
spirit.

During my undergraduate studies, I delved into the realms of AI and ML, culminating in my thesis titled
\textit{Deep-eANN: A Novel Approach for Improved Classification of Precursor microRNA Using
Artificial Neural Network Model}. This research achieved a prediction accuracy of up to 99\%, demonstrating
the potential of AI in advancing computational biology. My thesis not only marked my initial foray into
impactful research but also ignited a passion for developing innovative technological solutions to complex
challenges.

\ifshowsections\section*{Programming Contest Experience}\fi

My commitment to excellence extended beyond academics. I actively participated in over 150 programming
contests, both online and onsite, including regional competitions. These experiences honed my analytical
skills, teamwork, and ability to perform under pressure. As a blue coder on platforms like Topcoder and
Codeforces, I have successfully solved over 1,000 programming problems, further solidifying my expertise
in algorithms and data structures. Notably, I secured 14th place globally in Topcoder's Single Round
Match-497 Div-2 by solving all three problems, and I earned a reputable standing through 24 successful
data science solution hackings on Topcoder. These achievements reflect my dedication to continuous
learning and my ability to tackle complex computational challenges effectively.

\ifshowsections\section*{Personal Resilience and Sacrifices}\fi

During my second year of undergraduate studies, my father returned from overseas due to illness,
creating a need for me to support myself financially. As the second eldest among four siblings, I was
not only supporting my own living and education but also contributing to my younger siblings' expenses.
I started home tutoring students alongside my undergraduate education, earning enough to cover my
living expenses and educational costs until I graduated. This challenging period allowed me to cultivate
critical skills such as time management, leadership, and resilience. My efforts ensured that my younger
brothers could continue their education. One is now an undergraduate student, and the other is nearing the
completion of a marine degree. For over a decade, I prioritized their futures over my own aspirations,
investing all I had in their stability.

One memorable moment in my academic journey was solving a challenging dynamics problem on my own two days
after a contest where my team had struggled. This experience reinforced my belief in persistence and
individual effort, qualities I continue to rely on.

\ifshowsections\section*{Professional Experience}\fi

Spanning over a decade, my professional career has taken me across Bangladesh, Singapore, and the UAE,
allowing me to cultivate a diverse skill set in software and R\&D engineering. At Smarter AI in Dubai,
I led the development of \textbf{Instant Streaming\textsuperscript{TM}}, a groundbreaking feature that enabled
Dashcams to establish seamless connectivity within one second. This innovation significantly enhanced the user
experience and reliability of intelligent transportation systems. Additionally, I engineered advanced traffic
feature identification algorithms leveraging OpenStreetMap data, achieving high accuracy in real-time detection
of speed limits, school zones, and speed cameras. My role also encompassed modernizing legacy systems by
transitioning core SDKs to a REST API-based architecture, improving system concurrency and performance by
40\%. Furthermore, I designed and implemented a CI/CD pipeline that automated periodic analytics reporting
and health-report analyses using Kibana and Elasticsearch, streamlining internal processes and enhancing
client reporting capabilities.

At AnyConnect Private Limited in Singapore, I led the design and implementation of the Communication SDK,
merging my technical expertise with leadership to drive solutions that enhanced client interactions and
system efficiencies. My tenure at Eyeball Networks in Dhaka involved developing key features for the MS-SIP
Library, such as multi-video calls and codec adaptability, which were pivotal in improving communication
protocols and integral to client success stories.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have been recognized for my dedication and excellence.
In addition to my programming contest accolades, I was honored as the Heavy Lifter of Software Releases at Smarter
AI and received multiple Employee of the Month awards at AnyConnect Private Limited for exceptional performance
and dedication. These recognitions underscore my ability to deliver high-quality results consistently.

\ifshowsections\section*{Research Interests}\fi

My research journey began with my undergraduate thesis and has evolved through projects exploring real-time
systems, feature detection algorithms, and optimization techniques. These efforts have deepened my technical
expertise and strengthened my commitment to advancing computer science. My skills span multiple programming
languages (C++, Python, Java) and frameworks, as well as AI/ML tools that I have applied in various professional
settings.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of AI, ML, and IoT, with a focus on developing scalable algorithms
for large-scale applications, especially in intelligent transportation and autonomous systems. Through a PhD program,
I aim to explore cutting-edge methods in deep learning and optimization, contributing meaningfully to both academia
and industry.
